This repository contains the latest version of the generated Test01 application generated by 'genapp'. See gen01.sh in https://github.com/2kranki/genapp for details on it.  You should be able to clone this repository and build the application(s) and run it/them. I created this repository so that you would not have to run genapp if you did not want to, but could still see its output.

Normally, I clone into /tmp. That means that you lose all changes upon restart. So, you might want to clone to a different directory if you want to keep changes. Also, I have rebuilt this repository from scatch. So, you will have to reclone it if you have an older version.

The way that I test is to:


* `cd /tmp/app01/app01xx`   where xx is ma(mariadb), ms (mssql), my (mysql), pg (postgres), sq (sqlite)
* `b.sh` <- builds the application, */tmp/bin/app1*
* `t.sh` <- tests the various application components, */tmp/bin/app1*
* `/tmp/bin/app01xx` - starts the application (See xx above)
* `http://localhost:8080/` - Point your browser here
* `Load test data` - I generally only do the Customer table but it should not matter.
                        This will create the table and load 26 rows into it.
* `List Rows` - gives you a list of the rows in the table. From there, you can update rows.
* `Maintain Rows` - gives you a single page for each table row and allows you to progress
                    through the rows and update/delete rows.
* `^C` - to quit the application

Look in the "dbs" subdirectory for shell scripts to run the various SQL servers using Docker.

STATUS: 
    MariaDB, MS SQL, MySQL, PostGres and SQLite work for both,  the Customer and Vendor tables. 
    All tests are successful for every server executed in bash on MacOS. All the sql servers are running
    in docker except sqlite.
    
    Dockerfiles allow you to build the application to run in a docker container. If 
    you have docker installed, you should be able to build the docker container without
    having golang natively installed. All work, but 'sqlite' for now.

    Working on running the application in docker with the sql server running in
    docker as well. This utilizes docker-compose and is a work in progress.
